# Setup


## GoDot

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/hiulit/RetroPie-Godot-Game-Engine-Emulator.git
cd RetroPie-Godot-Game-Engine-Emulator/
sudo chmod +x setup-godot-engine-scriptmodule.sh
./setup-godot-engine-scriptmodule.sh --install
```
To update
```bash
cd ~/RetroPie-Godot-Game-Engine-Emulator/
git pull
./setup-godot-engine-scriptmodule.sh --update

To update the 'godot-engine' emulator, run:

'sudo /home/pi/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_setup.sh'

Go to:

|- Manage packages
  |- Manage optional packages
    |- godot-engine
      |- Update (from source)


```

NOTE: After running, I had to edit the /opt/retropie/configs/godot-engine/emulators.cfg file to remove the "--resolution x" line.

### Building/Exporting from GoDot

Download export template from: 

https://github.com/hiulit/Unofficial-Godot-Engine-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/README.md

* In the editor, go to Project -> Export.
* Select the Linux/X11 template.
* In Binary Format, uncheck 64 bits.
* In Custom template -> Release, select the version of the export template that matches the version of your project.
* Click Export Project.
* Uncheck Export With Debug.
* Optionally, after the game is packed, you can rename the extension of the game's executable binary from .x86 to .rpi4 to avoid confusion.

Optionaly, you can export a pck
* In the editor, go to Project -> Export.
* Select the Linux/X11 template.
* In Binary Format, uncheck 64 bits.
* Click Export PCK/ZIP.
* Uncheck Export With Debug.
* Enter the name of your game with the .pck extension.
* Click Save.

## ðŸŽ® How to run a game

### Case 1

- The is no `.pck` file (meaning that it's embedded/compiled in the executable binary).
- The `.pck` file has the same name as the executable binary and they are both in the same directory.

You can just run the executable binary, like this:

```
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext
```

### Case 2

- The `.pck` file has a different name than the executable binary.
- The `.pck` file is in a different directory than the executable binary.
- You are using an independent `.pck` file (without an executable binary).

You'll have to pass the `.pck` file's path using the `--main-pack` option, like this:

```
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_export-template.bin --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"
```
