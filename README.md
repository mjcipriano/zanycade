## ðŸŽ® How to run a game

### Case 1

- The is no `.pck` file (meaning that it's embedded/compiled in the executable binary).
- The `.pck` file has the same name as the executable binary and they are both in the same directory.

You can just run the executable binary, like this:

```
./name_of_your_godot_game.ext
```

### Case 2

- The `.pck` file has a different name than the executable binary.
- The `.pck` file is in a different directory than the executable binary.
- You are using an independent `.pck` file (without an executable binary).

You'll have to pass the `.pck` file's path using the `--main-pack` option, like this:

```
./godot_x.x.x_rpi4_export-template.bin --main-pack "/path/to/the/pck/file.pck"
```
